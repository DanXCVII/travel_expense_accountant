# Travel Expense Accountant

A [GitHub Pages website](https://danxcvii.github.io/travel_expense_accountant/) for calculating private travel expenses using a provided form. It was created to make the expense form easily accessible, especially on mobile devices and systems without PDF editors. The associated Flutter project can be found in the [travel_expense_accountant_source repository](https://github.com/DanXCVII/travel_expense_accountant_source).

## How to use?

The required data for the form can be entered into the fields provided within the form.
Attachments can either be dragged and dropped into the designated field below the form or selected via the file picker. Supported file formats include PDFs as well as images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .JPEG, .JPG).
The completed form will be available for download, and a preview can be viewed either on the left side or below the form, depending on the window size.
